## ASL-to-English Dictionary Web Application

Gretchen Marlow and Elizabeth A. Schlesener, Converse College

Faculty sponsors: Peter H. Brown, Margaret Park

### Welcome

Hello! ASL-to-English is an interactive dictionary web application for 
American Sign Language to English translation. The current version of this
application was made possible through a South Carolina Independent 
Colleges & Universities research grant. 

Throughout Spring 2018 this application will continue to be developed.
We hope to add more signs to the dictionary, and improve upon the user interface and mobile compatibility.

To try out the application please visit:
