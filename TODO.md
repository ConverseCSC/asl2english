# TODO items

- **More signs!**
- Improve look/usability
    - Too much presented at once
    - Ask questions one by one?
    - Integrate all the (many) body images (no more than 2)?
    - Show handshapes in 2 steps: class and then the one row (far less space)?
- Refactor/clarify code
    - functions.js needs organization (MVC)
    - sign.js: Sign class is too big, too much stuff coupled together
- Put TODO material in a better place
