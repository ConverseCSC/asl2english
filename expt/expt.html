        <h2>Overview of the experiment</h2>
        <p>In this experiment, you will be shown 10 ASL signs that we think you probably don't already know.  You will be asked to find the meaning of each sign either on the asl2english site or on the handspeak.com site.  For the first group of five signs, you will use one site.  For the second group of five signs, you will use the other site.</p>
        <p>After you look up each sign, you will be asked to enter its meaning (or &ldquo;Not found&rdquo; if you couldn't find it), together with how confident you feel in your choice.  After each group of five signs, you'll be asked to give feedback on the Web site you used to look up those five signs.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 3em;">When you're ready to begin, please enter your observer number below and click &ldquo;Submit&rdquo;.</p>
