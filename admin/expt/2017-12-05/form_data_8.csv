8,asl2english,,,,,,difficult,difficult,"i did not like this program at all because it is hard to find the signs using the 5 parameters of sign. i don't think a program similar to this would be helpful because if the person who trying to learn sign language and is not taking any college ASL class or in a ASL period they wouldn't know how to use the program or understand what it is asking because they have no idea what the 5 parameter of signs are."," i would change  the 5 perimeters of sign in this program that is use to find the sign that the person is looking for. I would remove the 5 parameters of sign use to search for the sign. i would try another approach."
