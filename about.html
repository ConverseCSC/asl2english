    <div class="padding">
        ASL-to-English is an interactive dictionary web application for 
        American Sign Language to English translation. The current version of 
        this application was made possible through a South Carolina Independent 
        Colleges & Universities research grant.
        The application was created by Gretchen Marlow and 
        Elizabeth A. Schlesener, with guidance from
        faculty sponsors Peter H. Brown and Margaret Park.

        It is our wish that this software be used in further research,
        and distributed to anyone who might find it useful. That is why we 
        have licensed it under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0, which you can find information

        However, a large part of this project is built off of research from individuals at 
        Boston University and Rutgers University in creating the American Sign Language
        Lexicon Video Dataset. The videos, glossed sign names, and handshape data are 
        all products of the work of these researchers, and this project would not have 
        been possible without them. The data that originates from their research 
        cannot be redistributed without their permision.
        To view the data and get more information about the permissions 
        please visit the <a href="http://www.bu.edu/av/asllrp/dai-asllvd.html">American Sign Language Lexicon Video Dataset</a>.
