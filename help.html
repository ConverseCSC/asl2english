        <b>What is ASL?</b><br>
        ASL stands for American Sign Language. ASL is a sign language used by many 
          deaf and hard-of-hearing communities in North America.

        <b>What is an ASL-to-English Dictionary?</b><br>
        An ASL-to-English dictionary allows you to search for an ASL sign through means
        other than just its English translation. You are able to take the visible characteristics
        of a sign and search with those to find the meaning. A search should return the 
        <a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/gloss.htm">glossed</a> English meaning
        and a video of the sign you are looking for.
        <br><br>
        <b>Why make an ASL-to-English Dictionary?</b><br>
        The purpose of this dictionary is to encourage and assist with ASL education. 
        Individuals who are learning ASL on their own or studying it in a school setting 
        might find this application useful for study and practice. Those fluent in ASL 
        could also use this application as a way to translate an ASL sign into English.

    <h2>Choosing Parameters</h2>
    <div class="padding">
        When searching, there are five parameters to set: 
        number of hands, handshape, palm orientation, location, and type of movement.
        All the parameters do not need to be set, but the results will be more accurate
        if done so.
        <br><br>
        We will explain each parameter in their own section, so skip to relevant 
        sections as needed.
        <br><br>
        <b>Number of Hands</b><br>
        For number of hands the options are "One-handed," 
        "Dominant hand moving, non-dominant stationary," and "Two hands moving." 
        This is a very important parameter to set as this choice will effect
        how many handshape options will be available to select. Choose the option that 
        best describes the sign you are looking for.
        
            <br><br>
        <b>Handshape</b><br>
        There are several different parts of the handshape parameter that can be set. For a one-handed sign, only the handshapes of the dominant hand
        can be set. For a sign using two hands, the handshapes for both hands can be set.
        Both the starting and ending handshape for a hand can be specified. 
        <br><br>
        When selecting, the starting and ending handshapes will automatially be set to 
        the same handshape. To change the ending handshape independent of the starting
        handshape, click on the button labelled "Ending handshape."
        <br><br>
        The pop up window that displays the different handshapes to select has a button
        at the bottom to display more, as not all handshapes are displayed initially. 
        It's important to note that each row of handshapes is a 
        "shape group," meaning those handshapes are closely related.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Palm Orientation</b><br>
        The options for palm orientation are forward, inward, sideways, downwards, upwards,
        and palm towards palm (if the sign is two handed). If the sign has multiple or 
        changing palm orientations, please choose the option that best describes the 
        starting palm orientation of the dominant hand. 
        <br><br>
        To clarify some of the options: "sideways" means a palm face that is facing to 
        the side, so a hand that is turned to face either the left or the right side. 
        "Palm towards palm" is used to describe a two handed sign where the palms of 
        the hands are positioned towards each other. The hands do not have to be touching,
        but it's okay if they do.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Location</b><br>
        The location parameter is made up of a drop down box labelled "Start/End" and 
        two figures labelled "Front view" and "Side view." 
        The drop down box selects what part of the location you are selecting currently, 
        either the starting position of the sign or the ending position. To select a 
        location, hover over the figures and click on the highlighted area that is the 
        closest match. A blue "X" or "O" should show up, depending on what "Start/End" 
        option is currently selected.
        <br>
        <br>
        Important to note: if the sign you're searching for involves two hands always 
        record the location of the dominant hand. Also, if the dominant hand is interacting 
        with the non dominant hand/wrist/arm, then record the location as "Hand," 
        "Wrist," or "Arm," even if the sign 
        is being performed in the center of the body.
        
        <br><br>
        <b>Movement</b><br>
        The options for describing movement are:<ul>
        <li>	None</li>
	        <li>Single movement in one direction (includes two handed signs)</li>
		<li>	Single movement with change in direction and/or handshape</li>
		<li>	Repeated movement (double, back-and-forth, up-down, in-out, wiggle, etc)</li>
		<li>	Repeated movement moving in one direction</li>
		<li>		Circular movement</li>
        </ul>
        The "None" option should be used for signs with no or very little movement. "Single 
        movement in one direction" is a simple, common movement where there is no change 
        in direction or change in handshape. The movement can be a straight line or an arc, and 
        with two handed signs the two hands can go in different directions. "Single movement with 
        change in direction and/or handshape" is a variation on the previous movement where there 
        is a significant change in direction within the movement or a change in handshape. 
        "Repeated movement" and "repeated movement moving in one direction" can look very similar,
        but "repeated movement moving in one direction" is commonly indicating the concept of 
        "plural" or "many." A circular movement can be any type of circular movement, regardless 
        of direction/orientation.
        <br><br>
        If a sign can be described by multiple of these movement options, choose the option 
        which is the most specific. The options are ordered from least to most specific.

<h2>Interpreting Results</h2>
    <div class="padding">
     After clicking the "Look for matching signs!" button, a number of videos will be displayed.
    These videos are showing signs being performed that match the various parameters chosen, with their
    <a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/topics/gloss.htm">glossed</a> English meanings labelled. 
        <br><br>
        There are multiple ways to sign the same concept, as well as variations of 
    the same sign. Occasionally, there will be a button underneath a video result reading
    "Show sign variation(s)." Clicking this will display some common variations of that sign.
        <br><br>
    If you do not see the sign you are looking for on the first page, click the "Next page" button at the 
    bottom of the page to see more. If you're still having trouble finding the right sign, try changing 
    a few of the parameters around and submitting again.
